Converting an ECS Task JSON file to a Kubernetes Deployment YAML involves translating ECS-specific configurations to Kubernetes-compatible syntax. Below is a step-by-step process with an example using the Docker image `discoverdevops/mywebapp:app-01`.

### Step 1: Examine the ECS Task Definition JSON

Review the ECS Task Definition JSON file to understand the container configurations, resource allocations, and other settings. Extract information such as container name, image, ports, environment variables, and volumes.

Example ECS Task Definition JSON (simplified for illustration):
```json
{
  "family": "mywebapp-task",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "mywebapp-container",
      "image": "discoverdevops/mywebapp:app-01",
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 80,
          "hostPort": 80
        }
      ],
      "environment": [
        {
          "name": "DATABASE_URL",
          "value": "mysql://dbhost:3306/mydatabase"
        }
      ]
      // Additional configurations...
    }
  ],
  // Additional configurations...
}
```

### Step 2: Translate ECS Task to Kubernetes Deployment

Create a Kubernetes Deployment YAML file (`deployment.yaml`) based on the information from the ECS Task Definition.

Example Kubernetes Deployment YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mywebapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Set the desired number of replicas
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mywebapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mywebapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mywebapp-container
        image: discoverdevops/mywebapp:app-01
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: DATABASE_URL
          value: "mysql://dbhost:3306/mydatabase"
        # Additional configurations...
```

### Step 3: Adjust Kubernetes-Specific Configurations

Kubernetes has its own configurations not present in ECS. Modify the Kubernetes Deployment YAML to include or adjust settings such as pod labels, service configurations, and resource requirements.

### Step 4: Apply the Deployment

Use `kubectl` to apply the Deployment YAML to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

Check the status and logs to ensure the deployment is successful and the containers are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs <pod_name>
```

### Notes:
- Ensure the Docker image (`discoverdevops/mywebapp:app-01`) is accessible from the Kubernetes cluster.
- Adjust resource allocations, environment variables, and other configurations as needed for your specific application requirements.

This example provides a basic translation, and depending on your ECS Task Definition's complexity, you may need to consider additional Kubernetes features and configurations. Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for detailed information: [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/).
