To define migration goals and establish clear objectives, as well as to identify success metrics, it's essential to engage the customer in a strategic discussion. Here are questions to ask the customer that will help in defining goals and setting success metrics:

### **Defining Migration Goals:**
1. **What are the primary motivations for considering a migration from AWS ECS to Oracle Cloud OKE?**
   - Understand the driving factors behind the decision to migrate and align goals with these motivations.

2. **What specific improvements or enhancements are you looking to achieve through the migration?**
   - Identify the areas where the customer expects positive changes, such as performance, scalability, or operational efficiency.

3. **Are there any pain points or challenges in your current ECS environment that you aim to address with the migration?**
   - Explore existing challenges that the customer hopes to overcome through the migration to OKE.

4. **In terms of application architecture, are there any changes or optimizations you wish to implement during the migration process?**
   - Discuss architectural considerations and potential optimizations to align with the customer's strategic vision.

### **Setting Clear Objectives:**
5. **What specific performance improvements are you aiming for with the migration to OKE?**
   - Define tangible performance goals, such as reduced latency, improved response times, or enhanced resource utilization.

6. **Are there specific cost optimization targets you have in mind for the OKE environment?**
   - Discuss cost-related objectives, including potential cost savings, optimized resource usage, or improved budget management.

7. **How important is it for your team to leverage advanced Kubernetes features as part of this migration?**
   - Gauge the customer's interest in adopting Kubernetes features and functionalities to enhance their container orchestration capabilities.

8. **Do you have specific expectations regarding the ease of management and operational efficiency in the OKE environment?**
   - Understand the customer's expectations regarding the day-to-day operational experience and efficiency gains.

### **Establishing Success Metrics:**
9. **What key performance indicators (KPIs) are crucial for measuring the success of the migration?**
   - Identify specific KPIs related to performance, cost, reliability, and other critical aspects to quantify the success of the migration.

10. **How would you define a successful migration in terms of application availability and reliability?**
    - Discuss the customer's expectations for application availability, reliability, and the impact on user experience.

11. **Are there any specific benchmarks or thresholds that you would like to see met or exceeded post-migration?**
    - Establish clear benchmarks or thresholds that will indicate the successful achievement of migration goals.

12. **Do you have a timeframe for achieving the outlined goals, and are there any time-sensitive milestones?**
    - Define a timeline for the migration and establish milestones to track progress toward the identified goals.

13. **What role do security and compliance play in determining the success of the migration?**
    - Understand the importance of security and compliance requirements and incorporate them into the success metrics.

By asking these questions, you'll gain insights into the customer's expectations, priorities, and specific outcomes they are looking to achieve with the migration. This information will guide the development of a tailored migration strategy and ensure alignment with the customer's overarching objectives.
